# Streamlit Car Price Prediction (ML)

This project is a car price prediction model that estimates the price of a car based on various factors such as the year of manufacture, kilometers driven,
tax, distance, and engine size. The data for this project was sourced from Kaggle, with car prices originally in GBP (Pounds). 
The prices have been converted to MYR (Malaysian Ringgit) for this model.

The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model using Linear Regression that can estimate car prices based on the given features. 
The model is deployed as a web application using Streamlit, allowing users to input car details and receive an estimated price.
